	<p>Howdy. I'm a full-time software developer with a hardware background and a penchant for minimal desgin and development. I have a mobile-first mentality and avoid paradigms that do not work well with modern mobile design. I love JavaScript&mdash;seriously&mdash;but I avoid it when I can; after all, it can just be disabled. I've developed for many platforms using many languages, including but not limited to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Linux &mdash; Used C to extend file system attributes and add custom functionality</li>
		<li>FPGA &mdash; Wrote hardware-level Verilog to recreate <em>Duck Hunt</em> on a Basys 2 Spartan-3E board</li>
		<li>Arduino &mdash; Used C to write an on-board controller for an autonomous search-and-rescue robot</li>
		<li>PC, OS X, Linux &mdash; Directed multiple game projects written in C# and made with Unity, from start to finish</li>
		<li>Android, iOS &mdash; Created cross-platform native applications with shared subrepositories</li>
		<li>WordPress &mdash; Developed multiple sites for a variety of clients with PHP, CSS, JS, and the like</li>
	</ul>
